This application does not target UI and frontend in general. The main purpose of this application is how to make an order tracking and inventory management application.
In the application, you can set up a company and add your own employees to that company and then place orders for other companies and follow the status of these orders. You can also add new products to your database and include these products in your orders. The orders placed are displayed on the screen of the company that placed the order and the company that received the order. Employees of both companies can see these orders.
